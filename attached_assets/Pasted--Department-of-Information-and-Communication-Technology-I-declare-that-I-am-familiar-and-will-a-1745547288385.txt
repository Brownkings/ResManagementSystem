Problem Statement: Restaurant Management System
In the current operational landscape of many mid-sized restaurants, such as Taste
Haven, management is confronted with growing inefficiencies stemming from
fragmented systems and outdated manual processes. Orders are handwritten by
waitstaff and physically delivered to the kitchen, which introduces delays, frequent
errors, and miscommunication. Reservations are managed through phone calls or penand-paper logs, often resulting in double-bookings or missed opportunities during highdemand periods. Furthermore, inventory tracking is handled through spreadsheets or
verbal checks, leading to inadequate stock monitoring and reactive purchasing
decisions. This disjointed approach hampers productivity, diminishes customer
satisfaction, and limits managerial oversight.
To address these systemic issues, management propose the development of a
comprehensive Restaurant Management System (RMS) to improve the user experience
for both their customers and staff members. The solution will digitize and integrate the
restaurant’s core operations—order processing, table reservations, and inventory
control—into a unified mobile-first platform. Waiters will utilize Android devices to
capture and transmit orders in real-time to the kitchen, eliminating manual handling and
reducing preparation delays. Customers will benefit from the ability to reserve tables and
receive confirmations directly via a user-friendly mobile app. Managers will have access
to up-to-date inventory levels, automated alerts for low-stock items, and real-time
analytics to guide purchasing and staffing decisions. This integrated system ensures
enhanced efficiency, greater data accuracy, and a significantly improved customer
experience within the hospitality environment.
Sample specifications are as follows:
Sample System Modules
1. Order Management Module
• Waiters take orders via Android devices.
• Orders are routed in real-time to kitchen staff's Android view.
• Orders progress through statuses: Received → Preparing → Ready → Served.
2. Table Reservation Module
• Customers can view available slots and reserve tables using the app.
• Confirmation notifications and booking history are available.
• Staff manage and override reservations via a managerial interface.
3. Inventory Tracking Module
• Managers input stock levels via Android or NetBeans backend.
• The system flags low stock items and recommends reorders.
• Logs are maintained for ingredient usage and wastage tracking.
4. Administrative Dashboard (Manager View)
• Overview of sales, orders, reservations, and stock metrics.
• Role-based access control: add/remove staff, update user roles.
• Generate operational and performance reports.
